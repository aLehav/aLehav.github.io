It is severely outdated to the age of the internet and globalization, and each sentence is written as unintuitively as possible. There is no knowledge here that is useful if not domain specific. At all. Got 200 pages through, kudos if you can do any more.`,

On a real note, an incredibly compelling author who convinced me in fervors blending history and fiction on topics of death and statehood independent of not caring about the fact that it is no longer the late 1800s and I am not a Russian Christian. Would love to read more Dostoevsky, or perhaps Tolstoy or Pushkin at his recommendation. I doubt I'll ever read his full diary.",

Compared to Lord Jim, I found this novel read more quickly with romantic and descriptive writing, but the exploration of ego is more nuanced. The Secret Sharer is well-written with characters who behave similarly to those in a Kafka novel, but it didn't inspire much in me personally.",
